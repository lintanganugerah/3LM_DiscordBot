# Local LLM to Discord Bot

A **Discord bot** connected to a **local LLM** (Large Language Model), allowing everyone to interact with it directly from Discord!  

I built this because I wanted my friends to **test a fine-tuned model** on **Bahasa Jawa** and **Bahasa Sunda**â€”and honestly, it's been pretty fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Why I Built This ?
I wanted an easy way for my friends to test and experience the capabilities of a locally fine-tuned model on regional languagesâ€”plus, it's just cool to see it working in real-time on Discord!

(3L stands for Local Large Language)

# Future Plans
- Add commands to allow users make their own system prompt. So everyone can customize AI Model Response to their liking!
- Add support for more local dialects and languages. Bahasa banjar next
- Optimize performance for faster replies. (Pls i need powerful GPU)
